# NAME

**ALPM-MTREE** - Package directory hierarchy description format.

# DESCRIPTION

The **mtree** format is a textual format that describes the hierarchy and metadata of files in a directory.

**mtree** is a well-known format that can, for example, be used for installation instructions or to verify files' metadata and the hierarchy of a directory.

The **ALPM-MTREE** format adheres to the official **mtree** specification.
However `mtree` files in the scope of ALPM only use a subset of all fields supported by the official **mtree**:

- `use-set`
- `type`
- `uid`
- `gid`
- `mode`
- `time`
- `size`
- `sha256`
- `link`

In Pacman **ALPM-MTREE** files are solely used to verify that installed files are identical to the original files without having to keep the original package around.
**.MTREE** files are implicitly generated and included when creating packages via `makepkg`.
The gzip-compressed **.MTREE** file is located in the root of ALPM based packages

The **ALPM-MTREE** format exists in multiple versions.
The information in this document is for version 2, which is the current version. It has been introduced with the release of pacman 6.1.0 on 2024-03-04.

## Changes since the last version

The **md5** field has been removed, effectively making this a breaking change.

# EXAMPLES

```
#mtree
/set type=file uid=0 gid=0 mode=644
./.BUILDINFO time=1696727741.0 size=5574 sha256digest=708be566788a6a2712bcd40425d93761569ede07371781374edb1f22e2a3eb96
./.PKGINFO time=1696727741.0 size=830 sha256digest=3aa17bec02b34c157e7c739c62e0e37a9d19f1459d404d7c6f2c14c6008127cd
/set mode=755
./usr time=1731613789.0 type=dir
./usr/bin time=1731613789.0 type=dir
./usr/bin/resolvconf time=1731613789.0 mode=777 type=link link=resolvectl
```

## Generation

ALPM's mtree files are generated by calling:

```sh
bsdtar \
  --format=mtree \
  --options='!all,use-set,type,uid,gid,mode,time,size,sha256,link' \
  $folder
```

## Usages

In the context of ALPM and `pacman`, the `mtree` file's main purpose is to provide a performant way of getting a package's file metadata without having to extract and read the whole package.

This data is then used to verify installed files on the target system against the original files from the package.
Take a look at `pacman`'s query check functionality for more detail.
