# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities.
Currently, only the most recent release of a crate is eligible for receiving such patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities on the [issue tracker] as a [confidential issue] with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

We will respond as quickly as possible after you open an issue.
However, please note that this project is maintained by volunteers, so response times may vary.
If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory and acknowledge your contributions as part of it.

This project follows a [coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD)] with a 90-day disclosure policy, meaning reported vulnerabilities will be addressed within 90 days before public disclosure.
